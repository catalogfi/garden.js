# Community
At Garden, we have always been vocal about our community-first ethos. We have allocated 65% of our [token](https://garden.finance/blogs/wbtc-garden-introducing-seed/?ref=wbtc-garden.ghost.io) supply to achieve our vision of a community-led Garden.

They say, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” We see Garden standing strong for a long time and reaching far into the DeFi ecosystem. We believe that with the help of our community, we are in the prime seat to get there.

We have two ongoing community incentive programs right now:
- [Seasons](../home/basics/token/Seasons.md)
- [Garden Ambassador Program](./GardenAmbassadorProgram.md)

Join our [garden town hall](https://discord.com/invite/Fp4ZmZZrFu) to be a part of our community and meet fellow gardeners.
