# 1inch Integration
Integrating an aggregator like 1inch with the `Garden SDK` would allow you to swap from any token to BTC and vice versa.

To swap from any token to BTC you'd need first to swap that token to WBTC and then use `Garden SDK` to swap from WBTC to BTC.

Similarly, to swap from BTC to any token, you first swap using the `Garden SDK` and then swap WBTC for the token you want.

## Integration
Coming soon!
