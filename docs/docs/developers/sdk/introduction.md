# Introduction

The `Garden SDK` is a set of typescript packages that allow you to bridge bitcoin to EVM based chains. The SDK is an abstraction over the garden APIs, providing developers to easily integrate garden components into their dapps.

Want to know how everything works internally? Check out core concepts [here](./core-concepts.md).

## Features

-   **Cross chain Swaps**: Swap assets between Bitcoin and EVM based chains.
-   **Compatibility**: The SDK is compatible with ethers.js or any other standard web3 providers making it easy to integrate with dapps.
-   **OTAs**: Create one time bitcoin accounts using your web3 providers, giving you access to all bitcoin wallet features.
