# Welcome to Garden

Garden allows Web3 apps to natively access Bitcoin liquidity. Bitcoin has a 51.4% market share of the crypto industry, but is still one of the least used assets in Web3 today. Our APIs and solutions remove the complexity and reduce the infrastructure overhead to use Bitcoin in your Dapp.

We offer a fully integrated suite of APIs that help you quickly build, launch, and scale your financial products across multiple EVM-compatible chains and Bitcoin.

Garden is currently live on the following [Mainnet and Testnet Chains](https://google.com).
