# SDK
The **Garden SDK** is a set of typescript packages that allow you to bridge Bitcoin to EVM-based chains. It is an abstraction over the Garden APIs, allowing developers to integrate Garden components into their dApps easily.

Want to know how everything works internally? Check out [Core Concepts](./CoreConcepts.md).

## Features
- **Cross-chain Swaps**: Swap assets between Bitcoin and EVM-based chains.
- **Compatibility**: The SDK is compatible with ethers.js or other standard Web3 providers making it easy to integrate with dApps.
- **OTAs**: Create one-time Bitcoin accounts using your Web3 providers, giving you access to all Bitcoin wallet features.
