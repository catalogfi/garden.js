# What is Garden?

Garden is the first instant Bitcoin liquidity layer in web3, a mobility/circulation module in the Bitcoin 2.0 stack. Whether you are a trader or a dApp, Garden enables blazing fast and accurately priced bitcoin liquidity for you.

Garden exists at the crossroads created by the Bitcoin renaissance, which led to three parallel budding Bitcoin ecosystems or the Bitcoin 2.0 stack:

1. **Bitcoin L1 and L2s**: Bitcoin as an ecosystem has become imaginative and moved from its 'liquid gold' beginnings. Ordinals and L2 chains have created an alternate BTC-powered DeFi ecosystem that wasn't considered possible before.
2. **Bitcoin on EVM**: Bitcoin accounts for 85% of all cross-chain volume. Being the biggest asset in Web3, Bitcoin-related use cases are a mainstay of EVM DeFi.
3. **Centralized Markets**: Bitcoin still tops the charts in Binance, and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs brought deserved credibility and institutional investments for Bitcoin.


Bitcoin 2.0 is like a complex financial organism with its various centralized, decentralized, and siloed parts. It requires a deep, instant, and ownerless liquidity layer to function. That's where Garden comes in. 

## Use Cases

### Swap
Use Garden's Swap function to trustlessly swap your BTC to WBTC and any other asset (coming soon!) in under 10 minutes on our [Supported Chains](./basics/SupportedChains.md).

If you're a new user, these guides will help you perform your first swap on Garden:
- [How to swap BTC to WBTC](./basics/guides/BtcWbtc.md)
- [How to swap WBTC to BTC](./basics/guides/WbtcBtc.md)
- [How to swap WBTC to WBTC](./basics/guides/WbtcWbtc.md)

To learn how swapping works under the hood, check out the [Swap](./basics/swap/Swap.md) section.

### Build
Garden is a community-driven project that encourages and appreciates developers' use of its composable dev stack to build cool Bitcoin cross-chain experiences.
If you're a developer looking to integrate or build on Garden, these are good places to start:
- [SDK](../developers/sdk/Sdk.md) : A simple guide to using the Garden SDK.
- [Cookbook](../cookbook/Cookbook.md) : If you're looking for some inspiration, you can find the projects cooked up by our devs and partners here! *chef's kiss*
To get your hands dirty in Garden (pun intended), check out the [Developers](../developers/Developers.md) section.

### Provide
Provide liquidity to Garden and earn fees by facilitating swaps. Check out [Liquidity Provision](./basics/LiquidityProvision.md) to understand the role of LPs or **Fillers** (as we like to call them) in the Garden ecosystem.

If you wish to run a filler, contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kqMBgeAKAh) to discuss the next steps. 

### Stake 
Garden's Staking program creates a [game-theoretic](https://garden.finance/blogs/market-making-and-staking/) mechanism to both incentivize HODLing **SEED** (Garden's [Token](./basics/token/Token.md)) and maintain Fillers' integrity. Check out [Stake](./basics/stake/Stake.md) to understand the role of **Stakers** in the Garden ecosystem.
