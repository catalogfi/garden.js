# Roadmap

## Vision
Garden strives to become the most liquid crypto exchange that allows you to trade any asset across any chain.
## Mission
We build user-centric financial applications, leveraging the best decentralized tech has to offer. 
### Key Principles
- **Bitcoin Focus**: Bitcoin is the biggest volume based on both marketcap and daily trading volume, but still one of the least represented asset in DeFi. We intend to change this, and allow every dApp to add support for Bitcoin within a day.
- **Deep Liquidity**: Garden has a deep focus on liquidity, we do not believe in recreating liquidity that already exists, we integrate all sources of decentralized and centralized liquidity to become the most liquid crypto exchange
- **User-Centric**: We believe in building products for users, so for us a user is at the center of every decision we make as a company.
- **Asset Catalog**: We support the most number of assets and asset pairs across DeFi. 

### Current Status
We are currently at 20% of our vision. Our focus areas include reducing swap times, enabling instant cancellations and refunds, and continuously improving the user experience.

## Roadmap
### 1. Improve Liquidity
**Objective**: Ensure Garden offers the best liquidity in the market, making it highly attractive for traders.
- **Increase Total Value Locked (TVL) and Volume**: Monitor and enhance TVL and trading volume as critical success metrics.
- **Open Source Liquidity**: Decentralized fillers allow anyone to become a liquidity provider, similar to Uniswap.
- **Expand Asset and Chain Support**: Continuously add new assets and blockchain integrations to broaden market coverage.
- **Lower Costs**: Make Garden cheaper than Binance for BTC trading, offering competitive rates to attract more users.

### 2. Enhance User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DevEx)
**Objective**: Create a robust, user-friendly application that sets the standard for UX in DeFi.
- **Improve App UX**: Ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use, with comprehensive user and developer documentation.
- **Increase Swap Speed**: Reduce the current swap time of 10 minutes to seconds.
- **Super Simple Integrations**: Make integrating with Garden straightforward, minimizing the need for extensive documentation.
- **Adopt Best Practices**: Regularly review and implement the best UX practices from across the industry.
- **Develop Mobile Application**: Launch a mobile version of the app to increase accessibility and user engagement.

### 3. Boost Reliability
**Objective**: Make Garden a dependable platform that users can trust for all their trading needs.
- **Systemic Product Flow Enhancements**: Refine product and order flow for a smoother user experience.
- **Instant Refunds and Automatic Redeems**: Implement features to handle instant refunds and automatic redemption of assets to improve user trust and satisfaction.
- **Robust Infrastructure**: Ensure the app is stable, secure, and capable of handling increased load as the user base grows.

### 4. Expand Asset and Chain Support
**Objective**: Continuously broaden the range of supported assets and blockchain networks.
- **Add More Assets**: Regularly integrate new assets to provide users diverse trading options.
- **Integrate More Chains**: Expand the number of supported blockchain networks to enhance interoperability and attract a wider user base.
