# Liquidity Provision
There are two ways to provide liquidity into the Garden ecosystem: 
- Providing liquidity to Garden (protocol) 
- Providing SEED liquidity on Uniswap (trading) 
### Providing liquidity to Garden
Gardeners can become order fillers by bonding 210,000 $SEED. Registered fillers get access to facilitate Gardenâ€™s order flow and receive the fee paid by the respective user. To be an efficient filler, a gardener should be able to run arbitrage bots, have accessible funds to provide liquidity, have tools/strategies to rebalance liquidity, and have the technical know-how to run these bots with no downtime.

**Requirement:** Staking 210,000 SEED + providing 10BTC liquidity. 
**Return:** 0.3% of the fees collected - (0.07% to stakers, 0.03% to integration partners, adjustable by filler).

*Detailed documentation on setting up a filler is under development; until then, if you wish to run an order filler, contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kqMBgeAKAh) to discuss the next steps.*
### Providing SEED liquidity on Uniswap 
Providing liquidity into the ETH/SEED pool on Uniswap V3 allows liquidity providers to earn a portion of the 0.30% trading fee applied to each trade. When you provide liquidity to a Uniswap token pair pool with a 0.30% fee, you earn a share of this fee proportional to your contribution to the total pool liquidity. This fee accrues directly within the pool and is realized upon withdrawal.

**Requirement:** Adding liquidity to the ETH/SEED pool.
**Return:** portion of .30% fee collected for each trade on Uniswap.
