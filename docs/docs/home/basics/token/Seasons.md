## Season 3 Ongoing 
Season 3 of Garden, dubbed Cherry Blossom ðŸŒ¸, is now underway, focusing on real-world usage of the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem via the Arbitrum network.

This allocation follows the 10 million SEED already distributed in previous seasons, with this season introducing direct token rewards for activities like swaps between BTC-WBTC and WBTC-WBTC. Participants can earn 100-150% of swap fees back plus SEED bonuses, with a chance at random multipliers, enhancing the potential rewards significantly.
