# Traders

Any person (or bot) who wants to use Garden to swap assets has their order flow protected from MEV bots, sandwiching bots, and all other parasite systems. The walled garden guarantees order execution once it is filled (or receive a 1% inconvenience fee), something no other DEX currently offers. Prices are optimised for the user through a meritocratic system to balance which fillers have a higher impact on the overall Garden UX.

Users can deposit and maintain a SEED balance inside Garden to pay discounted fees. This benefits the system holistically, as it is achieved through off-chain batching of transactions by a relayer, hence decreasing the cost per transaction execution. The fee that gets paid in SEED is settled (can be claimed) by fillers and stakers instantly or used as a fee for their own trades, unlike fees in other assets that are settled once per week (see Stakers).
