# Stakers

Stakers are decision makers in the walled garden that balance how order flow is assigned to fillers in the system, by actively voting for efficient fillers. If a filler gets 80% of the votes, they get ROFR for 80% of the volume at the best price offered by the eligible fillers.

Stakers maintain equilibrium by preventing any one filler from gaining a monopoly. Voting for underdogs carries slight risk but offers higher APY and vice-versa, preventing dominance and price manipulation. The voting system also minimises grim triggering, ensuring no gains from such strategy.

Staking for a filler means having their skin in the game. If a filler fails to settle an order within the allocated time, 0.33% of the trade value gets slashed from the stakes of their stakers. Hence, stakers must strike a balance, optimising between fillers that offer high payouts and minimise losses from slashing.
