# Fillers

Gardeners can become fillers in the walled garden by bonding 210,000 SEED. Registered fillers get access to facilitate Gardenâ€™s order flow and receive the fee paid by the respective user. To be an efficient filler, a gardener should be able to run arbitrage bots, have accessible funds to provide liquidity, have tools/strategies to rebalance liquidity, and the technical know how of running these bots with no down time.

The amount of volume fillers do is directly proportional to how efficiently they can execute orders. Efficiency is measured as the amount of fees a filler can pay to its stakers. A filler can promise X bips as the fee on the total weekly volume they do. So, the fee is success-based, dependent on the volume fillers settle. Thus incentivising fillers to build optimised bots and earn more. The fillers reach Nash equilibrium by paying as high of a fee as possible, as that would allow for the economies of scale to kick in and makes for optimal returns. Grim triggering is disincentivised by assigning volume thresholds per filler based on how efficiently they work.

If staker fees aren't paid promptly, responsible fillers are blocked for 7 days. If the fee remains unpaid during this grace period, their bond is grieved to their stakers. If a filler fails to settle an order within the allocated time, their bond gets slashed by 0.67% of the trade value. As the system evolves, more qualitative metrics are considered for slashing and measuring filler efficiency.
