what should be the auth, should i have to implement an siwe first ??




things to do in garden.js first

garden.ts ->
 should create starknetRelay and WalletClient ( Account ) for starknet.
 starknetRelay should have init() and redeem() functions

 should add starknet wallet in getAddresses() 
 should also write 

 in orderbook ->

 add starknet config
 constants

 gardenProps need to be changed 

 quote and attested quote - is starknet integrated in it?
 in SupportedAssets do i have to mention like which token ?? STRK ? WBTC ? ETH?
 are the starknet strategies implemented ?

 walletClient is not possible with starknet wallet, there is another object 
    called Account. do i have to add support for all the functions to support this Account object ?? in orderbook or
    garden and some util functions

 there is a method to create a walletclient like we can create a custom signer and pass it to the Account
 in order to not change all the code again to support the walletclient we can create something like convert this Account object to walletclient


 is there only one relayer which handles all the orders?


 so i just have to write a two functions which does a post request and the other thing is it should just call this contract with the initiate params
