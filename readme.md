# Garden SDK

The Garden SDK is a set of typescript packages that allow you to bridge Bitcoin to EVM-based chains. It is an abstraction over the Garden APIs, allowing developers to easily integrate Garden components into their dApps.

## Packages

- [@gardenfi/orderbook](./packages/orderbook/README.md): Allows you to create orders and listen to them.
- [@gardenfi/core](./packages/core/README.md): Allows you to interact with orders once you setup your wallets.

## Docs

Check out our [docs](https://docs.garden.finance/developers/sdk) to learn more about Garden and how to build on it.
