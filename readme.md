# Garden SDK

The Garden SDK is a set of typescript packages that allow you to bridge Bitcoin across multiple blockchain networks including EVM-based chains, Solana, Starknet, and Sui. It is an abstraction over the Garden APIs, allowing developers to easily integrate Garden components into their dApps.

## Packages

- [`@gardenfi/utils`](./packages/utils/README.md) : Provides shared utility functions.
- [`@gardenfi/wallet-connectors`](./packages/wallet-connectors/README.md) : Provides wallet adapters for Bitcoin wallet connectivity.
- [`@gardenfi/orderbook`](./packages/orderbook/README.md) : Allows you to create orders and listen to them.
- [`@gardenfi/core`](./packages/core/README.md) : Allows you to interact with orders once you setup your wallets.
- [`@gardenfi/react-hooks`](./packages/react-hooks/README.md) :React context and hooks for integrating Garden SDK with your UI.
